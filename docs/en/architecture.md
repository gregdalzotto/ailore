- **Chunking** is line-aligned so every chunk carries an exact line range — that's what makes citations precise.
- **Retrieval** is hybrid by default: an exact (brute-force) cosine scan for meaning, a BM25 ranking for exact tokens, fused with [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf). Both rankings run over the same stored chunks; the BM25 index is built in-memory at query time, so it needs nothing extra on disk. Switch to pure `vector` or `keyword` with `retrieval.mode`. See [Retrieval modes](./retrieval-modes.md).
- **Incremental** re-indexing hashes each file and skips unchanged ones; deleted files are pruned.

## The index

The index lives under `.ailore/` — no database to run, no native modules:

- **`index.json`** — lightweight metadata: per-file content hashes (for incremental updates), the chunk text with its `path:startLine-endLine` range, and the embedding model used.
- **`vectors.bin`** — the embeddings, packed as a contiguous binary `Float32Array` in chunk order. Keeping vectors out of the JSON makes `index.json` small and quick to parse, so loading a large index is fast.

Changing the embedding model triggers an automatic rebuild, since vectors from different models aren't comparable.

> [!NOTE]
> Older single-file (v1) indexes are read transparently and upgraded to this binary (v2) layout on the next `ailore index` — no re-embedding.

## Scale

Search is an exact cosine scan kept fully in memory — fast and accurate for small-to-medium codebases (up to roughly tens of thousands of chunks). For very large monorepos, scope the index to the relevant folders (`ailore index ./src`) or use `exclude` globs. An approximate-nearest-neighbour index is on the [roadmap](../../README.md#roadmap).
